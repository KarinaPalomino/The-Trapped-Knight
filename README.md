# The Trapped Knight
This project simulates the game The Trapped Knight by using simple code (utilizing for-loops, while-loops, recursives, arrays, and functions) 
and simple mathematical subjects (inequalities, recursive equations, addition). 
This is my first project on the program language, Julia. 

### How to play
The Trapped Knight is a simple game that starts on an odd numbered $n$ x $n$ chess board with the center being $1$ and numbers increasing in a counter-clockwise spiral from the center. 
The knight starts in the center, at $1$, and has $8$ possible moves (just as a normal knight would move in chess). Although, in the game the knight can only move to the smallest number.
From there we continue the game until the knight reaches a number that is on the edge of the board.

### How it was planned
As this was a class assignment, I had a good amount of instructions on how to format the code. Nevertheless, I first started with a layout of my own personal format on paper.
I planned out how I wanted my code to look like and went through the plans reading it as if I were the computer (very literal). The debugging process began once I transfered 
my plans onto the computer, as that was were I could test if my ideas and equations had work. Most of my time was spent debugging the second part of the project, especially the simulate_walk function.
My debugging strategies were utilizng the Test package in julia, printing, and comparing to other classmates ideas.
